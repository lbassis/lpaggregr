* Example Cholesky (full spatial aggregation always)
** With small-scale existing trace
- [X] Existing traces from pjdump

- [X] Modified script to consider only application tasks
  [[./example_cholesky.R]] You can run it with Rscript.
- [X] Resulting Rplots.pdf will show the temporal aggregation for all values of P.
